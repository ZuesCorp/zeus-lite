      <div class="sample-block">
        <div class="sample-line"><strong>Product:</strong> CarPlay / Android Auto wireless adapter (USB-C)</div>
        <div class="sample-line"><strong>Profit potential:</strong> Premium perceived value supports higher pricing. Easy upsells (fast-charging cable, magnetic mount) and bundles (2-pack for multiple cars).</div>
        <div class="sample-line"><strong>Why it's moving:</strong> Huge audience with older vehicles that have wired CarPlay. "Life upgrade" content performs well because the benefit is instantly understandable.</div>
        <div class="sample-line"><strong>Best ad angle:</strong> Turn wired CarPlay into wireless in 10 seconds with a simple plug-in demo and a clean before/after experience.</div>
        <div class="sample-line"><strong>Likelihood to purchase:</strong> High if the ad proves compatibility + speed and removes the "will this work with my car?" objection.</div>
